# Introduction
The spectator camera is the core feature of Pryde. With our spectator camera control, you are able to fully customize the recording camera without even touching any code. Besides, in the case if you do want to programatically script camera motion the way you want, we also have dedicated custom camera mode for it.

## Camera Motion Regime Presets
We offer a variety of pre-defined camera motion regime that are suitable to a wide range of content types including fast-paced action type, fixed position interaction type, teleport enabled indoor puzzle type, etc. Each preset offers an unique way of moving and aiming the camera with most of the relavent variables tweakable at runtime.
