The panel will stream PrydeVR's camera view so you can clearly see what's going on\n\n\nWe've configured PrydeVR camera using the \nOrbit Smooth\n mode. You should be able to see a small camera preview panel floating in the air that is orbiting around you. If you find it, say hi to our VR camera rig! We embedded the preview panel so it's easy for players to find the camera and be able to see what the camera sees. You can easily turn it off in the PrydeVR control panel if you don't need it.\n\n\nBy default, the recording can be started and stopped by pressing the X key in your keyboard. We provided other mapping options including some that use the Vive Controllers. You can change them in the PrydeVR gameobject. We also have an easy to use voice command system setup if you would like to use your own voice to control the recording.\n\n\n\n\nPress X key to start record\n. Alternatively, you can use our built-in voice command system (requires Internet connection). Simply say out loud \n\"start recording\"\n to start. Once you started recording, you should see the camera preview panel start to blink red indicating the capturing has already started.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nFeel free to move around and teleport. The PrydeVR camera will smoothly follows you as you move.\n\n\n\n\nPress X again to stop recording\n. If you prefer using voice command, just say out loud \n\"stop recording\"\n to stop. By default, video file will be created in the \"PrydeVR\" folder under current Windows user's Documents folder. However, you can easily customize the output folder in the PrydeVR control panel. The path to the file will also output to the console window.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nYou can record as many times as you want and each session will create a separate video file.\n\n\n\n\n\n     \n\n   \n\n\n\n\nApply PrydeVR to Your Own Game\n\uf0c1\n\n\n\n\nOpen SteamVR interaction system example scene located at: Assets/SteamVR/InteractionSystem/Samples/Scenes/Interactions_Example\n\n\nDrag the PrydeVR prefab under \nAssets/PrydeVR/Prefabs/\n to anywhere in your scene hierarchy\n\n\nAll done. No kidding! Now hit play and you should be able to record and share!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nPretty easy-to-use, right? Now that you are all set with the setup, keep in mind that we also support you with many options to fully customize PrydeVR the way you like.\n\n\n\n\nSelect the PrydeVR gameobject that you just imported in your scene hierarchy and you should see the PrydeVR control panel. Let's go through every single one of them in the next section.\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustomize Your Own Camera Rig\n\uf0c1\n\n\nPrydeVR now supports customizing your own camera rig since SDK v0.5.0. This allows you to fully customimze the recording camera the way you want. Below is an example taking use of the custom camera feature to make a hand-held camera rig in under 60 seconds.\n\n\nFirst, make sure PrydeVR SDK is already imported to you Unity project.\n\n\nUnder \nAssets/PrydeVR/Scenes/\n, open the example scene\n\n\nClick PrydeVR gameobject again, find \nCamera Follow Regime\n and select \nCustom Camera\n. Then leave \nCamera Local Position\n to (0, 0, 0) and update \nCamera Local Rotation\n to (\n30\n, 0, 0).\n\n\nEnable \nShow Camera Preview\n and then update \nCamera Preview Position\n to (0, 0, \n0.4\n) and \nCamera Preview Rotation\n to (\n60\n, \n180\n, 0). Leave \nCamera Preview Scale\n to its default 1.\n\n\nNow drag the \nHand1\n gameobject under \nPlayer/SteamVRObjects/\n to \nTarget Camera\n to make the reference. Now you are all set! Your setting should looks like the example below.\n  \n\n    \n\n  \n\n\nGo ahead hit play.
